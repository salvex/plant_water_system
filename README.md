This project involves the creation of an automated plant irrigation system. The system uses a humidity sensor to monitor the moisture level in the soil. If the moisture level falls below a predefined threshold, the system triggers a water pump to automatically water the plant.

The project includes several key hardware components, such as the humidity sensor, microcontroller, and water pump. The humidity sensor measures the soil's moisture level and sends this data to the microcontroller. If the moisture level is too low, the microcontroller activates the water pump, ensuring the plant receives the necessary hydration.

The physical architecture of the system is designed to integrate all these components seamlessly. This includes not only the hardware but also the interactions between the sensor, microcontroller, and pump. The components are chosen and arranged in such a way that the system operates efficiently and reliably.

After describing the components and their interactions, the project undergoes a design analysis to ensure the system is built to meet its intended purpose. This involves evaluating the overall implementation and fine-tuning any aspects to optimize performance.

Finally, the project concludes with a detailed explanation of the code used to control the system. Each part of the code is explained in detail, providing insight into how it operates and how it interacts with the hardware components, ensuring the irrigation system functions as intended.
